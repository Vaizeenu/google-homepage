# google-homepage
A recreation of the google homepage using html and css for educational purposes.

This is my first attempt to recreate an existing webpage, the google homepage. 

## What will I do in this attempt: 
    - Create a repository in github and clone it locally
    - Commit and push updates to local and remote repository
    - Create the html file needed for the google homepage
    - Create the CSS file needed to portray the elements on the page accurately.
    - Use multiple selectors with disregard to homogeny or legibility for educational purposes.

## What I won't do in this attempt: 
    - I won't create a usable form 
    - I won't create hover stuff for the various elements of the google homepage.
    - I won't use any js, as I do not know it yet. 


## A simple timeline of process:
    - Created github repository
    - Cloned repository locally
    - Created readme containing some info about project
    - Created basic html structure, containing header, footer, and main area.
    - Filled header, footer, and main area with content, adding placeholders in place of images for now
    - Created css stylesheet and started on header
    - Formed horizontal navbar from html list, correctly placed navbar, styled font-size, color, and distance between elements of list. 
    - Added icon in html navbar, placed and styled it correctly in css. Painted "login" button in top right and used padding and margin to approximate original button measurements.
    - Started styling on footer. Added grey background, and top and bottom borders, and correctly made them go until the edges of the screen using padding and not margin.
    - Transformed list elements in inline elements using float on container ul.
    - Will finish tomorrow since i'm tired.
