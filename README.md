# google-homepage
A recreation of the google homepage using html and css for educational purposes.

This is my first attempt to recreate an existing webpage, the google homepage. 

## What will I do in this attempt: 
    - Create a repository in github and clone it locally
    - Commit and push updates to local and remote repository
    - Create the html file needed for the google homepage
    - Create the CSS file needed to portray the elements on the page accurately.

## What I won't do in this attempt: 
    - I won't create a usable form 
    - I won't create hover stuff for the various elements of the google homepage.
    - I won't use any js, as I do not know it yet.
